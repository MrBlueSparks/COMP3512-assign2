This is a simple product-viewing Single Page Application built with Javascript and Tailwind CSS (via CLI)
This project was solely developed by Rhys Barker


## Project Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, install all required npm packages:
```bash 
npm install
```

### 2. Build Tailwind CSS
Generate the CSS from the Tailwind configuration:
```bash

### 3. Run the Application
You can run the app in two ways:

**Option A: Using a local server (recommended)**
```bash
npx serve .
```
Then open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in terminal)

**Option B: Direct file opening**
Simply open `index.html` directly in your browser (file:// protocol)
